# AT&T- Churn Analysis using Power BI

## Project Overview
This Power BI project is focused on analyzing customer churn for AT&T. It involves multiple interconnected data tables that capture various aspects of customer demographics, contract details, and churn behavior. The model visualizes and measures key metrics like churn rate, customer lifetime value (CLTV), and churn reasons, enabling in-depth analysis of factors influencing customer retention and churn patterns. The relationships between tables allow for comprehensive insights, such as the impact of demographics, service usage, and geographic location on churn rates.

***Customer Churn Analysis*** is the process of identifying and understanding the reasons why customers stop doing business with a company. It involves analyzing data to predict which customers are likely to leave (churn) and identifying the factors that contribute to this behavior. This analysis helps companies take proactive steps to retain customers and improve overall business performance.  

## Why is Churn Analysis Important?
* ***Customer Retention:*** Retaining existing customers is often more cost-effective than acquiring new ones. Churn analysis helps businesses understand why customers leave, allowing them to address issues and improve retention rates.
* ***Revenue Impact:*** High churn rates can significantly impact a companyâ€™s revenue. By identifying and mitigating the causes of churn, businesses can stabilize and potentially increase their revenue streams.
* ***Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV):*** Understanding churn helps in calculating the customer lifetime value more accurately. It enables companies to focus on strategies that maximize the value of each customer over time.
* ***Improved Customer Experience:*** Churn analysis often reveals areas where customers are dissatisfied. Addressing these areas can lead to improved customer satisfaction and loyalty, which in turn reduces churn.
* ***Targeted Marketing:*** With insights from churn analysis, businesses can create targeted marketing campaigns aimed at at-risk customers, offering them incentives or personalized experiences to retain them.
* ***Competitive Advantage:*** Reducing churn gives businesses a competitive edge by ensuring that they maintain a loyal customer base while potentially attracting customers from competitors who are less effective at retention.
