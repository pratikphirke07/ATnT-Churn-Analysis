# AT&T- Churn Analysis using Power BI

## Project Overview
This Power BI project is focused on analyzing customer churn for AT&T. It involves multiple interconnected data tables that capture various aspects of customer demographics, contract details, and churn behavior. The model visualizes and measures key metrics like churn rate, customer lifetime value (CLTV), and churn reasons, enabling in-depth analysis of factors influencing customer retention and churn patterns. The relationships between tables allow for comprehensive insights, such as the impact of demographics, service usage, and geographic location on churn rates.

***Customer Churn Analysis***is the process of identifying and understanding the reasons why customers stop doing business with a company. It involves analyzing data to predict which customers are likely to leave (churn) and identifying the factors that contribute to this behavior. This analysis helps companies take proactive steps to retain customers and improve overall business performance.
